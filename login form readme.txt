Design Philosophy
Neumorphism creates the illusion that interface elements are carved from the same material as the background:

Soft Realism: Elements appear physically embossed or carved
Minimal Contrast: Subtle color variations maintain cohesion
Tactile Feedback: Interactions feel like pressing physical buttons
Depth Hierarchy: Shadow layers create natural information hierarchy
Ambient Light: Mouse movement simulates changing light source
Interactive Elements
Soft Press Effects: Elements compress when pressed
Ambient Lighting: Shadows respond to mouse position
Gentle Transitions: All animations are soft and natural
Scale Animations: Subtle scaling for hover feedback
Progressive Enhancement: Graceful degradation on older browsers
Accessibility Considerations
Low Contrast Warning: Neumorphism can have accessibility issues
Focus Indicators: Clear focus states for keyboard navigation
Color Independence: Visual hierarchy doesn't rely solely on color
Screen Reader Support: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
High Contrast Mode: Fallback styles for accessibility settings
